## Purpose
To help a missionary couple by providing a low-cost website.


## What I learned
This site was my first project utilizing the Gatsby framework. Of which, gave me an accesible starting point for learning React apps at a high-level.

I am proud of the simple design this website utilized and I've carried it foward to future builds.

## Future Progress

The missionary couple has since moved on from Dare For More, so the website is no longer in use. 

The couple started their own ministry that focues on serving widows and orphans. We carried over the design from missionsformore.com to <a>oneson.org</a> which utilizes Wordpress and Themify.
